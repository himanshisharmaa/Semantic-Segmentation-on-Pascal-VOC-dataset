### Implementation of semantic segmentation on Pascal VOC dataset using PyTorch

The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, specifically for tasks related to object detection, classification, and segmentation. It was introduced as part of the Pascal VOC challenges, which began in 2007 and continued through to 2012.

The dataset consists of a diverse set of images containing objects from 20 different classes, including people, animals, vehicles, and various household items. Each image is annotated with object bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and labels, providing a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Key features of the Pascal VOC dataset include:

- **Image Annotations**: The dataset includes detailed annotations for object detection (bounding boxes) and pixel-level segmentation (segmentation masks) for each of the 20 object classes.
- **Diversity**: The images in the dataset represent a variety of scenes, lighting conditions, and object appearances, making it suitable for testing the robustness of vision algorithms.
- **Challenges**: The Pascal VOC challenges have played a significant role in advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision by providing a standard evaluation framework, encouraging researchers to develop more accurate and efficient algorithms.
